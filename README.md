# sensitivityq
This package provides the implementation of the proposed method in 'Sensitivity Analysis for Quantiles of Hidden Biases in Matched Observational Studies',
which extends Rosenbaumâ€™s sensitivity analysis to infer all quantiles of the biases across all sets, extending previous works that essentially focusing on the maximum bias.

## To install the package
First, you need to install the devtools package. You can do this from CRAN. Invoke R and then type

`install.packages("devtools")`

Load the devtools package.

`library(devtools)`

Then do

`install_github("dongxiao-wu/sensitivityq")`

To import the package, simply do `library('sensitivityq')`.

## Two main functions in this package

The two main functions in this package are:

`senmk()`: calculate p-value, statistics, expectation and variance for the extended sensitivity analysis of a specific quantile of biases and a specific sensitivity parameter Gamma.

`Gamma_seq()`: calculates lower confidence limits for the biases at rank k's(for a sequance of k as needed) across all matched sets.

For more informations, see the help pages in the package.
